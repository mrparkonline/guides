## Reason For This Guide

This machine was really well priced the for the hardware included. I have been using a MacBook Pro since 2010 as a daily driver for my laptop use, and I found that a lot of the benefits of using the macOS is **missing** with a Windows.

This is not a complete guide / reproduction of the macOS productivity; however, it will be continuously updated as I find better alternatives to quirks that I find with the Windows OS.

PS. **_The apple trackpad is heavily missed._**

## Step 1: Reinstall Windows OS

_There was a lot of crap installed with odd settings when I first booted up my computer._

Even with running a dedicated uninstaller for most of the _bloatware_, Microsoft Windows Update continuously re-added some applications back, and HP provided some weird applications installed already.

It seems that when applications are installed in Windows, they leave a lot of hidden files, temporary files, and/or registry stuff throughout the computer; therefore, I found myself feeling better with a clean reinstall of the Windows OS.

```**Note:** Depending on the model/make/producing company, some features of your laptop may behave differently -or- misbehave.```

# Looking at Laptops (June 2020)
---

Laptops are one of the most difficult things to purchase. A lot of different configurations, OS differences, price efficiency and different use cases make the laptop search very complex.

There is also the ridiculousness of price inefficiency when compared to a custom built desktop computers and the fact that Apple ecosystem requires **a lot of money**.

## Our Dream Laptop

Our list of priorities when we look for a daily machine.
- ```Portable``` > It should be easy to carry and easy to use in lecture halls and/or at the library.
- ```Battery Life``` > Looking for a plug continuously should be a pre-2020 problem, I hope that this decade's machine will last a full **working** day. _Notice the emphasis on working, not gaming._
- ```Screen``` > It is 2020, we should be working from 1920x1080 at least. Due to thin bezels, 14" would be a great size to carry around.
- ```Minimum Specification for Comfort``` > This is the specification that I would want:
  - **CPU:** At least Dual-Core+. AMD Mobile Processors seems to be outperforming the new 10th Intel Mobile Processors; however, certain programs are optimized for Intel Processors. You may want to look at what your University program uses throughout the years.
  - **GPU:** Most of you don't need a dedicated GPU in your laptop. Unless you are doing GPU related work or coding, this shouldn't be a priority. If you do get a laptop with dedicated graphics, get one with NVidia as it has the most programs that are optimized with their GPU.
  - **RAM:** 8 GB+ right now, 8 GB should be the minimum, to future proof I would get a laptop with empty DIMM slots or go with 16 GB.
  - **Hard Drive:** It should be a solid state inside your machine. You will thank me when your laptop loads up before your Ramen is done cooking. For size, 256 GB should be minimum for you. If there are extra SATA or NVME slots, it would be preferred for future upgradeability.
- ```Interfaces``` > You will do presentations, you may need an ethernet cable, you will need to connect extra peripherals and you will need external hard drives. Look at what you may need and make sure your laptop can support it, or you will live the dongle life.
- ```Trackpad + Keyboard``` > One of my biggest reason that I used my MacBook Pro 2012 until now was its Trackpad and its Keyboard. It is the two main component of the laptop that you are interacting the most, it should be good and suited for you.
- ```Fixability & Upgradeability``` > This was also another big plus for my 2012 MacBook Pro. The SATA drive was replaceable to an SSD, and the RAM Modules were not soldered so that I can upgrade it. Most of the hardware issues that I faced during its long tenure, I was able to fix on my own.
- ```Webcam``` > The pandemic is still going on, and we honestly have no idea when it will be over. You might want to have a built-in webcam for all your Google Meets and Zoom meetings.

All or most of these checkpoints can be found at various price points. It will be easier as you spend more, and you will be sacrificing/compromising more as you spend less.

The way that I look at laptop purchase are dependent these thought points:
- How much am I willing to spend?
- Am I willing to spend that much again if the laptop breaks down?
- Is the laptop the best one at that price point or can I find similar specifications for $100 to $200 lower or can I gain drastic improvements if I spend $100 to $200 extra.

## Laptops @ Price Points

**WARNING:** Our CAD is super weak, so don't expect American pricing. I also have not read reviews or tried any of these devices, so I am giving you a starting point.

#### Under $500 CAD.

For a good portion of 2010 to 2020, there was a very nice ecosystem of great sub $500 laptops. These days, not so much because of the dominance of Chromebooks.

I support Chromebooks 100%. They are amazing basic machines for people who does the bare minimum on a computer. For CS & CS-related students, you probably won't be satisfied with a Chromebook being your main device.

Also note that, $500 can build you a very satisfactory desktop workstation.

**Devices to Consider:**
- Chromebooks w/ 8 GB RAM and 128 GB Storage that support Linux
- Refurbished Machines (DELL/HP/LENOVO) from previous generations that meets your requirements. Just make sure that they are certified with good reviews.
- **[Bauer Systems](https://www.bauersystems.com/)** is a Canadian company that sells refurbished machines. They have a Google Sheet containing a list of their inventory. Sign up for their mailing list to get it.

#### $500 to $999.

This is a _weird_ price range. You might find almost everything you want in terms of specification, but it will have one flaw (battery, RAM Size, HD Size or weak CPU). This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some that I've found. Remember that flag ship phones are in this _price range_.

I think the best tip for this price range is looking at the $1000 to $1499 devices to fall under $1000 due to sales/student pricing. Also, try to go to BestBuy to see these laptops in action, try typing on them and then wash your hands with hand sanitizer.

#### $1000 to $1500.

I believe that this price range is where all the main flag ship laptops are sold from companies.

**Flagship Models:**
- Dell XPS
- HP Spectre
- Lenovo ThinkPad
- ASUS ZenBook
- Apple MacBook Pro

If you have this kind of money, you should be happy with any of the models listed above. With these devices, you should try them out in store and read/watch many **MANY** reviews. I really hope that $100~ differences between these devices shouldn't matter at this point because this is your daily machine for a while if you were to drop this much money here.
